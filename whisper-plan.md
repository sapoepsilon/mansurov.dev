- [x] Add responsive image galleries
- [x] Integrate video demos with proper loading
- [x] Implement tech stack badge system
- [x] Add smooth scroll animations
- [x] Create interactive feature demonstrations

## Phase 4: Testing & Verification

### Manual Testing
- [x] Test on localhost using Playwright MCP
- [x] Verify responsive design on multiple devices
- [x] Check all links and media loading
- [x] Validate project content accuracy
- [x] ~~Test navigation between projects~~ (Only one project)

### End-to-End Testing
- [x] Write Playwright tests for project navigation
- [x] ~~Test project filtering and search~~ (Not implemented for single project)
- [x] Verify project detail page functionality
- [x] Test responsive layout breakpoints
- [x] ~~Validate form submissions~~ (Not needed for hardcoded data)

### Performance & SEO
- [ ] Optimize images and media loading
- [ ] Add proper meta tags for project pages
- [ ] Implement structured data for projects
- [ ] Test page load speeds
- [ ] Verify accessibility compliance

## Phase 5: Deployment & Documentation

### Git Management
- [ ] Commit each phase with proper commit messages
- [ ] Use conventional commit format
- [ ] No Anthropic mentions in commits
- [ ] Create feature branches if needed

### Documentation Updates
- [ ] Update CLAUDE.md with project architecture
- [ ] Document design language usage
- [ ] Add project management workflows
- [ ] Update environment variables if needed

## Success Criteria

✅ **Design Language**: Reusable components for future projects  
✅ **Whispera Showcase**: Comprehensive project presentation  
✅ **Responsive Design**: Works on all device sizes  
✅ **Performance**: Fast loading and smooth interactions  
✅ **Maintainable**: Easy to add new projects using design language  
✅ **SEO Optimized**: Proper meta tags and structured data  

## Next Steps After Completion

1. User approval of implementation
2. Run full E2E test suite
3. Performance audit
4. Ready for next project addition using established design language
